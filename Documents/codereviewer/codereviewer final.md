- **discussion_id** (`str`): The ID of the discussion thread.
- **note_id** (`str`): The ID of the specific note or comment.
- **private_token** (`str`): The private token used for authentication.
- **note_body** (`str`): The body of the note or comment.
- **response** (`str`): The response generated by the AI agent.
