## two strategies of dealing with big data

1. cluster of computers 
2. scaling up - more powerful compouter 
### Core 
1. instruction pointers aligns with - processes
2. multiple processes can be assigned to different cores
### Processes
1. stores machine code and data

	4 processes - 2 cores -> 2 times


C: high level code -> compiler -> Machine code
JAVA PYTOHN: high level code -> compiler -> bytecode <- JVM



## Block devices
HDD and SSD -> extract a block of data(more than bytes)


### Metrics for data persistence
1. capacity
2. throughput : how fast can deata be read/written
3. latency of IO



using one shell in another shell: security shell - e.g. using a shell from server access by my computer ssh shell.




tail -n 20

tail -f keep showing the tail




ls -l  shows bytes - bits and permissions of files
ls -a show hidden and normal files
ls -hl human readable


+add permission
